A remake of https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/579835309/ in GameMaker, with a lot of extra content.
Honestly I don't really know why I did this. It was pretty fun.
I tried to be accurate to the original, as long as it was fun to play and as long as it was even possible.
Due to the way scratch operates, It's very hard to faithfully recreate things 1:1 in GameMaker.

99% of the game's image assets are not mine. 
All of the image assets are copied directly from the Scratch game (barring the bandage, which is from [here](https://clipground.com/images/bandage-clip-art-11.jpg)) 
and so is some of the movement code, so obviously huge credits to 
[Wildy](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/WildyOhok/) who made the Scratch game.
There is also [Snvyv](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/snvyv/) who created "Cate" (no remixes) which eventually lead to the bossfight, 
plus [Vity6](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/vity6/) and [Bloccjo](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/bloccjo/) who participated in remixing Cate.

The newly added hard mode was inspired by [JohnDavid901's](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/JohnDavid901/) remix of Cate, which also made the game harder.
You can watch a video of his version [here.](https://youtu.be/y3w17FL-DGs)

Most of the sound files are not mine either, most are from Undertale/Deltarune, and two of them are from Sonic & Knuckles, obviously those are not mine.


Feel free to PR any fixes, improvements, additions, whatever

I don't know how licenses work or if this should even be licensed, but you can do whatever the hell you want, I don't care
