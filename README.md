# cate-gms2
A remake of https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/579835309/ in GameMaker Studio 2.
Honestly I don't really know why I did this. It was pretty fun.
I tried to be accurate to the original, as long as it was fun to play and as long as it was even possible.
Due to the way scratch operates, It's very hard to faithfully recreate things 1:1 in GMS2.


99% of the game's image assets are not mine. 
All of the image assets are copied directly from the Scratch game, and so is some of the movement code, so obviously huge credits to 
Wildy (https://scratch.mit.edu/users/WildyOhok/) who made the Scratch game.
There is also Snvyv (https://scratch.mit.edu/users/snvyv/) who created "Cate" (no remixes) which eventually lead to the bossfight, 
plus Vity6 (https://scratch.mit.edu/users/vity6/) and Bloccjo (https://scratch.mit.edu/users/bloccjo/) who participated in remixing "Cate".

The same goes for sound files, most are from Undertale/Deltarune, and one from Sonic & Knuckles, obviously those are not mine.

I don't know how licenses work or if this should even be licensed, but you can do whatever the hell you want, I don't care
