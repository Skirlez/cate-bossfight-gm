A remake of https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/579835309/ in GameMaker Studio 2.
Honestly I don't really know why I did this. It was pretty fun.
I tried to be accurate to the original, as long as it was fun, and as long as I actually could make it accurate. Due to the way scratch operates, It's very hard to faithfully recreate things 1:1.


99% of the game's assets are not mine. All the assets are copied directly from the game, and so is some of the code, so obviously huge credits to Wildy (https://twitter.com/wildythomas1233) who made the original scratch project.
The game contains sound files from Undertale/Deltarune, and Sonic & Knuckles, obviously those are not mine.
All I did was write the code.


I don't know how licenses work or if this should even be licensed, but you can do whatever the hell you want, I don't care
